Which jobs are most crucial?
-Optimal implementation of moves on the cube faces
-Having the cube respond and provide visual feedback to the user



Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
-Reading 3D array of data into a presentable display of cube (essential)
-Rotating the cube and choosing which face to be the modified (essential)
-Have a self solving method(non)
-Have a cube that the user can "color" according to whatever their real-life cube's arrangement may be(essential)
-Scrambling the cube to be resolved by the user(essential)


Which components are prerequisites for others?
-Being able to display a cube in one form or another
-Being able to do moves to alter the cube's appearance

Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
-Delegated:
-coding movement of cube(i.e. rotating)
-display of cube
-cube color selection(and limitations of where certain colors can be placed)
-scrambling of cube

-Collaboratively tackled:
-devlogs
-plans
-proposal updates/solidifing
-readme
-solving algorithm
