Which jobs are most crucial?
-Figuring out the simplest solving algorithm to implement into code
-Deciding what way do we want to display our cube: showing all sides simultaneously or only one at a time


Which components constitute core functionality (vs non-essential)?
-2D display of our cube(essential) 
-3D version(non)
-Creating an interactive cube that the user can use(essential)
-Have a self solving method(non)
-Have a cube that the user can "color" according to whatever their real-life cube's arrangement may be(essential)

Which components are prerequisites for others?
-Being able to display a cube in one form or another
-Creating a rotating mechanism that allows us to interact with the cube itself

Which tasks can be delegated, and which must be collaboratively tackled?
-Delegated:
-coding movement of cube(i.e. rotating)
-display of cube
-cube color selection(and limitations of where certain colors can be placed)

-Collaboratively tackled:
-devlogs
-plans
-proposal updates/solidifing
-readme
-solving algorithm
